## Description

Allows visitors to search the site using their voice. Currently only supported by Chrome on both desktop and mobile. See [this technical reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for more details.

See [this blog post](https://spinpress.com/wordpress-web-speech-api/ "Enabling Voice Search in WordPress Using The Web Speech API") for further information about the plugin.

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Upload the entire `/voice-search` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate Voice Search through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Visit your website and start searching using your voice.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is there no microphone button beneath the search form?

There could be many reasons for this:

* You’re not Google Chrome (check out the browser support [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=web-speech))
* Your theme doesn’t use the `get_search_form()` function properly. The plugin relies on the default search form markup
* Your theme does some CSS things that prevents the microphone button from being displayed.

### Does this plugin still allow users to type or does it entirely replace typing with voice search?

No, users are still able to type in the search box whatever they want. Voice search is just a nice addition.

### How does it integrate with other search-enhancing plugins such as Relevanssi?

In my tests there weren’t any problems with other plugins like Relevanssi.
